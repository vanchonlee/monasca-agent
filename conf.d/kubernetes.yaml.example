    # it via host or by setting derive_host to True. We derive the host by first using the kubernetes environment
    # variables to get the api url (assuming we are running in a kubernetes container). Next we use the container's pod
    # name and namespace (passed in as environment variables to the agents container - see kubernetes example yaml file)
    # with the api url to hit the api to get the pods metadata including the host it is running on. That is the host we
    # use.
    # NOTE - this plugin only supports one instance.
