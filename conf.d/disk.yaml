init_config:
# process_fs_path: (optional) STRING. It will set up the path of the process
# filesystem. By default it's set for: /proc directory.
# Example:
#
# process_fs_path: /rootfs/proc
instances:
    # Disk check only supports one configured instance
    - name: disk_stats
      # Add a mount_point dimension to the disk system metrics (Default = True)
      #use_mount: False

      # Send additional disk i/o system metrics (Default = True)
      #send_io_stats: False

      # Send additional disk rollup system metrics (Default = False)
      # These metrics include the following metrics aggregated across all disks:
      # disk.total_space_mb and disk.total_used_space_mb
      #send_rollup_stats: True

      # Some infrastructures have many constantly changing virtual devices (e.g. folks
      # running constantly churning linux containers) whose metrics aren't
      # interesting. To filter out a particular pattern of devices
      # from the disk collection, configure a regex here:
      # device_blacklist_re: .*\/dev\/mapper\/lxc-box.*

      # For disk metrics it is also possible to ignore entire filesystem types
      ignore_filesystem_types: iso9660,tmpfs,nsfs
      device_blacklist_re: .*freezer_backup_snap.*
