# Libvirt VM Monitoring

## Overview
The Libvirt plugin provides metrics for virtual machines when run on the hypervisor server.  It provides two sets of metrics per measurement: one designed for the owner of the VM, and one intended for the owner of the hypervisor server.

## Installation
Install `libvirt` plugin system dependencies
```
apt install libvirt-dev pkg-config
```

Install `libvirt` plugin Python dependencies
```
pip install monasca-agent[libvirt]
```
It will install `libvirt` packages like `libvirt-python`, `python-novaclient`
and `python-neutronclient`.

## Configuration
The `monasca-setup` program will configure the Libvirt plugin if `nova-compute` is running, its `nova.conf` config file is readable by the Monasca Agent user (default: 'mon-agent'), and `python-novaclient` is installed.

In order to fetch data on hosted compute instances, the Libvirt plugin needs to be able to talk to the Nova API.  It does this using credentials found in `nova.conf` under `[keystone_authtoken]`, obtained when `monasca-setup` is run, and stored in `/etc/monasca/agent/conf.d/libvirt.yaml` as `username`, `project_name`, and `password`.  These credentials are only used to build and update the [Instance Cache](#instance-cache).

The Libvirt plugin uses a cache directory to persist data, which is `/dev/shm` by default.  On non-Linux systems (BSD, Mac OSX), `/dev/shm` may not exist, so `cache_dir` would need to be changed accordingly, either in `monasca_setup/detection/plugins/libvirt.py` prior to running `monasca-setup`, or `/etc/monasca/agent/conf.d/libvirt.yaml` afterwards.

If the owner of the VM is in a different tenant the Agent Cross-Tenant Metric Submission can be setup. See this [documentation](https://github.com/openstack/monasca-agent/blob/master/docs/MonascaMetrics.md#cross-tenant-metric-submission) for details.

`username` is the username capable of making administrative nova calls.

`password` password for the nova user.

`project_name` is the project/tenant to POST metrics with the `vm.` prefix.

`auth_url` is the keystone endpoint for auth.

`endpoint_type` is the endpoint type for making nova/neutron calls.

`region_name` is used to add the region dimension to metrics.

`nova_refresh` specifies the number of seconds between calls to the Nova API to refresh the instance cache.  This is helpful for updating VM hostname and pruning deleted instances from the cache.  By default, it is set to 14,400 seconds (four hours).  Set to 0 to refresh every time the Collector runs, or to None to disable regular refreshes entirely (though the instance cache will still be refreshed if a new instance is detected).

`metadata` specifies the list of instance metadata keys to be included as dimensions with the cross-tenant metrics for the operations project. This is helpful to give more information about an instance. When using the agent setup scripts, by default `scale_group` metadata is enabled for supporting auto scaling in Heat. VM name and tenant name (in addition to default IDs) can be provided as dimensions if `vm_name` and `tenant_name` are provided in the list of metadata keys.

`customer_metadata` specifies the list of instance metadata keys to be included as dimensions with customer metrics. This is helpful to give more information about an instance.

`vm_probation` specifies a period of time (in seconds) in which to suspend metrics from a newly-created VM.  This is to prevent quickly-obsolete metrics in an environment with a high amount of instance churn (VMs created and destroyed in rapid succession).  The default probation length is 300 seconds (five minutes).  Setting to 0 disables VM probation, and metrics will be recorded as soon as possible after a VM is created.

`ping_check` includes the entire command line (sans the IP address, which is automatically appended) used to perform a ping check against instances, with a keyword `NAMESPACE` automatically replaced with the appropriate network namespace for the VM being monitored.  Set to False (or omit altogether) to disable ping checks.  See [ping checks](#ping-checks) below for more detail on how ping checks are set up and how they work.

`max_ping_concurrency` specifies the number of ping command processes that will be run concurrently. This should be set to a value that allows the plugin to finish within the agent collection period even if there is a networking issue. For example, if the expected number of VMs per compute node is 40 and each VM will have one IP Adddress and using the default ping timeout of 1 seconds, if all of the pings fail and `max_ping_concurrency` is 1, then the plugin will take at least 40 seconds to do the ping checks. Increasing `max_ping_concurrency` will allow the plugin to finish faster. The default value is 8.

`alive_only` will suppress all per-VM metrics aside from `host_alive_status` and `vm.host_alive_status`, including all I/O, network, memory, ping, and CPU metrics.  [Aggregate Metrics](#aggregate-metrics), however, would still be enabled if `alive_only` is true.  By default, `alive_only` is false.

`network_use_bits` will submit network metrics in bits rather than bytes.  This will stop submitting the metrics `net.in_bytes_sec` and `net.out_bytes_sec`, and instead submit `net.in_bits_sec` and `net.out_bits_sec`.

`disk_collection_period` will cause disk metrics to be output at a minimum `disk_collection_period` second interval. This can be optionally set to have disk metrics be outputted less often to reduce metric load on the system. If this is less than the agent collection period, it will be ignored. The default value is 0.

`vnic_collection_period` will cause vnic metrics to be output at a minimum `vnic_collection_period` second interval. This can be optionally set to have vnic metrics be outputted less often to reduce metric load on the system. If this is less than the agent collection period, it will be ignored. The default value is 0.

`vm_cpu_check_enable` enables collecting of VM CPU metrics (Default True). Please see "Mapping Metrics to Configuration Parameters" section below for what metrics are controlled by this flag.

`vm_disks_check_enable` enables collecting of VM Disk metrics (Default True). Please see "Mapping Metrics to Configuration Parameters" section below for what metrics are controlled by this flag.

`vm_network_check_enable` enables collecting of VM Network metrics (Default True). Please see "Mapping Metrics to Configuration Parameters" section below for what metrics are controlled by this flag.

`vm_ping_check_enable` enable host alive ping check (Default True). Please see "Mapping Metrics to Configuration Parameters" section below for what metrics are controlled by this flag.

`vm_extended_disks_check_enable` enable collecting of extended Disk metrics (Default False). Please see "Mapping Metrics to Configuration Parameters" section below for what metrics are controlled by this flag.

`host_aggregate_re` can be used to specify a regular expression with which to match nova host aggregate names.  If this hypervisor is a member of a host aggregate matching this regular expression, an additional dimension of `host_aggregate` will be published for the operations metrics (with a value of the host aggregate name).

Example config:
```
init_config:
    password: pass
    project_name: service
    username: nova
    auth_url: 'http://192.168.10.5/identity'
    endpoint_type: 'publicURL'
    region_name: 'region1'
    cache_dir: /dev/shm
    nova_refresh: 14400
    metadata:
    - scale_group
    customer_metadata:
    - scale_group
    vm_probation: 300
    ping_check: /opt/stack/venv/monasca_agent-20160224T213950Z/bin/ip netns exec NAMESPACE
      /bin/ping -n -c1 -w1 -q
    max_ping_concurrency: 8
    alive_only: false
    network_use_bits: false
    vm_cpu_check_enable: True
    vm_disks_check_enable: True
    vm_network_check_enable: True
    vm_ping_check_enable: True
    vm_extended_disks_check_enable: False
    host_aggregate_re: None
    disk_collection_period: 0
    vnic_collection_period: 0
instances:
    - {}
```
`instances` are null in `libvirt.yaml`  because the libvirt plugin detects and runs against all provisioned VM instances; specifying them in `libvirt.yaml` is unnecessary.

Note: If the Nova service login credentials are changed, `monasca-setup` would need to be re-run to use the new credentials.  Alternately, `/etc/monasca/agent/conf.d/libvirt.yaml` could be modified directly.

Example `monasca-setup` usage:
```
monasca-setup -d libvirt -a 'ping_check=false alive_only=false' --overwrite
```

## Instance Cache
The instance cache (`/dev/shm/libvirt_instances.json` by default) contains data that is not available to libvirt, but queried from Nova.  To limit calls to the Nova API, the cache is only updated if a new instance is detected (libvirt sees an instance not already in the cache), or every `nova_refresh` seconds (see Configuration above).

Example cache (pretty-printed):
```
{
   "last_update" : 1450121034,
   "instance-00000005" : {
      "created" : "2015-12-14T19:10:07Z",
      "instance_uuid" : "94b8511c-d4de-40c3-9676-558f28e0c3c1",
      "network" : [
         {
            "ip" : "10.0.0.3",
            "namespace" : "qrouter-ae714057-4453-48c4-81cb-15f8db9434a8"
         }
      ],
      "disk" : 1,
      "tenant_id" : "7d8e24a1e0cb4f8c8dedfb2010992b62",
      "zone" : "nova",
      "scale_group": "a1207522-c5fb-4621-a839-c00b638cfb47",
      "vcpus" : 1,
      "hostname" : "vm01",
      "ram" : 512
   }
}
```

## Metrics Cache
The libvirt inspector returns *counters*, but it is much more useful to use *rates* instead.  To convert counters to rates, a metrics cache is used, stored in `/dev/shm/libvirt_metrics.yaml` by default.  For each measurement gathered, the current value and timestamp (UNIX epoch) are recorded in the cache.  The subsequent run of the Monasca Agent Collector compares current values against prior ones, and computes the rate.

Since CPU Time is provided in nanoseconds, the timestamp recorded has nanosecond resolution.  Otherwise, integer seconds are used.

Example cache (pretty-printed excerpt, see next section for complete list of available metrics):
```
{
   "instance-00000005" : {
      "net.tx_bytes" : {

Memory statistics require a balloon driver on the VM.  For the Linux kernel, this is the `CONFIG_VIRTIO_BALLOON` configuration parameter, active by default in Ubuntu, and enabled by default as a kernel module in Debian, CentOS, and SUSE.

Since separate metrics are sent to the VM's owner as well as Operations, all metric names designed for Operations are prefixed with "vm." to easily distinguish between VM metrics and compute host's metrics.

### Ping Checks
The Libvirt plugin provides the ability to perform an ICMP ping test against hosted VMs.
It is helpful for determining, for example, if a VM is in a panicked or halted state, which in both cases may appear to the hypervisor as "Running / OK."  However, in order for ping checks to work, certain environmental requirements must be met.

#### Requirements
1. Neutron L3 agent in DVR mode (legacy mode is supported on single-node installations, such as devstack).
2. Neutron L2 plugin with a tenant network type of `vlan` or `vxlan` (other types may be supported, but have not been tested).
3. The `python-neutronclient` library and its dependencies installed and available to the Monasca Agent
4. Each VM needs an appropriate security group configuration to allow ICMP

#### Detection
The monasca-setup detection plugin for libvirt performs the following tests and tasks before configuring ping checks:

1. Ability to determine the name of the user under which monasca-agent processes run (eg, `mon-agent`)
2. Availability of the `python-neutronclient` library (by attempting to import `client` from `neutronclient.v2_0`)
3. A separate enhanced-capabilities `ip` command exists:
   a. The detection plugin copies `/sbin/ip` to `sys.path[0]/monasca-agent-ip` (see the [configuration](#configuration) section above for an example)
   b. Permissions on the copy are changed to the `mon-agent` user (or whichever Agent user is configured), mode 0700.
   c. The `/sbin/setcap` command is called, applying `cap_sys_admin+ep` to the copy, as `cap_sys_admin` is the only capability which provides `setns`, necessary to execute commands in a separate namespace.
   d. The detection plugin confirms that the enhanced capabilities were successfully applied
4. Existence of a ping command; detection will try `/usr/bin/fping`, `/sbin/fping`, and `/bin/ping` in that order.  `fping` is preferred because it allows for sub-second timeouts, but is not installed by default in some Linux distributions.

If any of the above requirements fail, a WARN-level message is output, describing the problem.  The libvirt plugin will continue to function without these requirements, but ping checks will be disabled.

#### Algorithm
Instance IP and namespace information is stored in the instance cache, rebuilt only when a new VM has been detected, or every 300 second (by default), whichever comes first.  Here is the general algorithm for how IP, namespace, and security parameters are detected.

First, build a list of all Neutron ports (networks).  This list will be referenced frequently later.  Connection to the Neutron API, through python-neutronclient, uses the same authentication credentials as calls to the Nova API.  These credentials are captured from nova.conf and stored in libvirt.yaml during the monasca-setup process.

Look for the presence of network namespaces on the compute node by running `ip netns list`.  This determines if:

1. Neutron is running in distributed-routing mode
2. Neutron is running in legacy or centralized-routing mode but on a single node (a la devstack)

If no network namespaces have been found, there is no need to continue trying to fetch information to support ping checks.

Assuming namespaces have been found, poll Neutron for a complete list of security groups, and store these as a dictionary object for quick access.

Start walking through each detected VM instance.  Each instance can have one or more Neutron networks, and each network can have one or more interface.  If the interface has a 'fixed' IP address (as opposed to floating), consult the port cache to find the subnet ID for that IP address.  The subnet ID is a unique identifier that will be used to find the correct namespace ID, which is also found in the port cache.

Once we find an active matching router interface for the tenant and VM interface subnet ID, we can verify that the VM's security policy allows ICMP from that router interface's IP address (see Client Configuration below for an example of this IP address).

The process of looking for namespaces and security rules occurs each time the instance cache is refreshed, so for normal operation, all this information is stored in the instance cache.

#### Client Configuration
The VM owner would need to add a security rule to allow ICMP access to their VM.  The simplest implementation would be to allow ICMP globally:

    $ nova secgroup-add-rule default icmp -1 -1 0.0.0.0/0

However, more security-conscious customers may not want the world to ping their VM, so at a minimum, ICMP needs to be allowed for the subnet gateway IP address.

#### Troubleshooting

To limit false negative, ping checks will not be performed unless all the requirements are met.  The most direct way to verify all the requirements are met for a single VM is to look at the `/dev/shm/libvirt_instances.json` file on the compute node where the VM is hosted.  Any VM that meets all the requirements will have a "network" section, containing the IP address and network namespace for each correctly-configured device.
```
"network" : [ { "ip" : "10.0.0.3", "namespace" : "qrouter-ae714057-4453-48c4-81cb-15f8db9434a8" } ],
```
You can attempt to ping the IP address through the given namespace with a command like

    $ sudo ip netns exec qrouter-ae714057-4453-48c4-81cb-15f8db9434a8 ping 10.0.0.3

Other questions you could ask, if ping checks are not configured, are:
* Do _any_ VMs have the "network" section in `/dev/shm/libvirt_instances.json`?  If so, security rules for the VM in question may be the cause.
* Does the command `ip netns list |grep qrouter` produce any output on the compute node?  If not, perhaps Neutron is not configured in DVR mode, or no VMs are present on that compute node.
* Is the `ping_check` command defined `/etc/monasca/agent/conf.d/libvirt.yaml`?  If not, try running `monasca-setup -d libvirt` as root from within the appropriate Python virtual environment

## Mapping Metrics to Configuration Parameters
Configuration parameters can be used to control which metrics are reported by libvirt plugin. There are 5 parameters currently in libvirt config file: vm_cpu_check_enable, vm_disks_check_enable, vm_network_check_enable, vm_ping_check_enable and vm_extended_disks_check_enable.

### Untunable Metrics
#### Prerequisite
By default, the memory statistics feature is disabled in qemu. You need to add
stats period in order to enable them.
* Enable stats period of memballoon device. Add default
`mem_stats_period_seconds=10` into `/etc/nova/nova.conf` file. Restart
nova-compute service: `sudo systemctl restart openstack-nova-compute`
* Make sure your image includes the suitable balloon driver, particularly
for Windows guests, most modern Linuxes have it build in. For `cirros`
distribution, it's available from version 0.4.0.

#### Untunable Metrics List
Please see table below for metrics in libvirt.

| Admin Metric Name | Tenant Metric Name |
| ----------------- | ------------------ |
| vm.host_alive_status | host_alive_status |
| vm.mem.free_mb | mem.free_mb |

## VM Dimensions
All metrics include `resource_id` and `zone` (availability zone) dimensions.  Because there is a separate set of metrics for the two target audiences (VM customers and Operations), other dimensions may differ.

| Dimension Name | Customer Value            | Operations Value                                                  |
